# Multi-Selection Feature for Notes Application

## Overview
This feature allows you to select multiple note buttons in the container panel by dragging a selection rectangle (like Windows desktop icons) and move them together as a group.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Drag-to-Select**
- Click and drag on empty space in the panel to draw a selection rectangle
- All buttons that intersect with the rectangle will be selected
- Visual feedback: blue dashed rectangle with semi-transparent fill

### 2. **Visual Selection Indicator**
- Selected buttons display a blue border (3px width)
- Clear visual distinction between selected and unselected buttons

### 3. **Group Movement**
- Click and drag on any selected button to move all selected buttons together
- All buttons maintain their relative positions during group movement
- All positions are saved when the group movement is complete

### 4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **Ctrl+A**: Select all buttons (when in movable mode)
- **Escape**: Clear current selection
- **Delete**: Delete all selected buttons (with confirmation dialog)

### 5. **Multi-Selection Modes**
- **Replace selection**: Click and drag to create a new selection (clears previous selection)
- **Add to selection**: Hold Ctrl while dragging to add to existing selection

### 6. **Smart Interaction**
- Single button drag still works as before
- Group movement only activates when clicking on an already-selected button
- Right-click functionality preserved for creating new notes

## How to Use

### Basic Selection
1. Enable "Movable" mode from the Edit menu (or press Ctrl+D)
2. Click and drag on empty space in the panel
3. A blue selection rectangle will appear
4. Release the mouse button to select all buttons within the rectangle

### Moving Selected Buttons
1. After selecting multiple buttons, click on any selected button
2. Drag to move all selected buttons together
3. Release to place them in their new positions

### Adding to Selection
1. Make an initial selection
2. Hold Ctrl and drag another selection rectangle
3. New buttons will be added to the existing selection

### Keyboard Operations
- Press **Ctrl+A** to select all buttons
- Press **Escape** to deselect all buttons
- Press **Delete** to remove all selected buttons (confirmation required)

## Implementation Details

### New Variables Added
- `isSelecting`: Tracks if user is currently drawing selection rectangle
- `selectionStart`, `selectionEnd`: Start and end points of selection rectangle
- `selectedButtons`: HashSet containing all currently selected buttons
- `isMovingGroup`: Tracks if user is moving a group of selected buttons
- `groupOriginalPositions`: Stores original positions for group movement

### Event Handlers Modified/Added
- `panelContainer_MouseDown`: Initiates selection rectangle drawing on empty space
- `panelContainer_MouseMove`: Updates selection rectangle while dragging
- `panelContainer_MouseUp`: Completes selection rectangle and selects intersecting buttons
- `panelContainer_Paint`: Draws the selection rectangle
- `frmMain_KeyDown`: Handles keyboard shortcuts for selection
- `newButton_MouseDown`: Initiates group movement when clicking a selected button (if multiple selected)
- `newButton_MouseMove`: Handles group movement by moving all selected buttons together
- `newButton_MouseUp`: Completes group movement and saves all button positions

### Methods Added
- `SelectAllButtons()`: Selects all buttons in the container
- `SelectButton()`: Adds a button to the selection
- `DeselectButton()`: Removes a button from the selection
- `ClearSelection()`: Clears all selections
- `UpdateButtonSelectionVisual()`: Updates visual appearance of selected buttons
- `SelectButtonsInRectangle()`: Selects buttons intersecting with rectangle
- `UpdateSelectionRectangle()`: Calculates selection rectangle bounds
- `DeleteSelectedButtons()`: Deletes all selected buttons with confirmation

### How It Works
1. **Selection**: Dragging on empty panel space creates a selection rectangle; buttons intersecting it get selected
2. **Group Movement**: Clicking on any selected button when multiple are selected initiates group movement
3. **Coordinate Conversion**: Mouse coordinates are converted from button space to panel space for smooth group movement
4. **Visual Feedback**: Selected buttons show a 3px blue border using FlatStyle.Flat appearance

## Notes
- Multi-selection only works when "Movable" mode is enabled
- Single button interactions (click to copy, double-click to edit) still work normally
- Selection is cleared when refreshing buttons or loading new data
- Visual selection indicator uses FlatStyle.Flat for clear border rendering
